# Github Tools Chrome Extension

An example demonstrating a few Github site tweaks, such as:

* Triggering full-width mode with an access key of `K`. This might be `Alt+K` or `Ctrl+Opt+K` depending on your platform. See [access key details](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_key#Access_in_different_browsers).
* Fixed-width font for editing comments in code reviews.
* Change tab size from 8 to 4.

## Warnings

1. I made this extension in order to make a few changes to Github that I personally wanted. At this point, I don't plan to release it in the Chrome Extensions store, but feel free to issue pull requests against it if you can think of other features that would be helpful. Maybe if we get enough features we can consider sharing it in the store.
2. Github changes their HTML and features sometimes, so over time, the features of this extension can break.
3. When you enable "Developer Mode" in Chrome, you might get warnings whenever it starts up.

## Installation

* Git clone the repo or download the zip and unzip it into the directory of your choice
* Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
* Checkmark "Developer mode"
* Click "Load unpacked extension"
* Choose the directory where you saved the files
* Go to [Github](https://github.com) and do stuff!
